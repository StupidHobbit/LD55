~ beholder_description

Note: Beholder. An all-seeing demon of knowledge.
Note: Named for its solitary cyclopean eye, the Beholder is a creature of pure evil. 
Note: It has the fascinating and gruesome form of a monstrous floating spheroid.
Note: Its entire body is dominated by a single, massive eye, which never closes.
Note: Despite its odd physical form, a Beholder proves to be intelligent and full of spite towards anything not like itself.
Note: To summon the Beholder, a chilling ritual bound by dark mysteries and ancient magic, is performed.
Note: This ritual involves a special pentagram known only to a few, [color=blue][u]catâ€™s-eye amulet[/u][/color] and the rare root of a [color=green][u]mandragore[/u][/color].
Note: Despite its malignant nature, the Beholder, when summoned within the right aspects of the pentagram, becomes temporarily shackled by the laws of the summoning.
Note: During this brief window of control, it ensures the Beholder becomes surprisingly cooperative, answering truthfully any query put forth.
