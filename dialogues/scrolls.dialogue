~ beholder_description

Note: Beholder. An all-seeing demon of knowledge.
Note: Named for its solitary cyclopean eye, the Beholder is a creature of pure evil. 
Note: It has the fascinating and gruesome form of a monstrous floating spheroid.
Note: Its entire body is dominated by a single, massive eye, which never closes.
Note: Despite its odd physical form, a Beholder proves to be intelligent and full of spite towards anything not like itself.
Note: To summon the Beholder, a chilling ritual bound by dark mysteries and ancient magic, is performed.
Note: This ritual involves a special pentagram known only to a few, [color=blue][u]catâ€™s-eye amulet[/u][/color] and the rare root of a [color=green][u]mandrake[/u][/color].
Note: Despite its malignant nature, the Beholder, when summoned within the right aspects of the pentagram, becomes temporarily shackled by the laws of the summoning.
Note: During this brief window of control, it ensures the Beholder becomes surprisingly cooperative, answering truthfully any query put forth.

~ hastur_description

Note: Hastur is one of the ancient ones, a mythical creature that brings death to some and madness to others.
Note: Little is known about him, but his bright, unblinking eyes, visible from the darkness of his hood and the seemingly weightless body hidden behind his cloak, to doubt who it is when you see him.
Note: In order to summon him, you need a [color=blue][u]star grass[/u][/color], a [color=green][u]Hastur's amulet[/u][/color] while wearing a [color=YELLOW][u]solar amulet[/u][/color] which surrounds the wearer with an aura of sunshine and grants him protection from the all-devouring darkness emanating from Hastur.
